# microservices-devops-1

This is an advanced end-to-end devops project that uses Jenkins as a continuous integration server to set up a working pipeline for a microservices application.

This project is the first part of a 2-part project that applies GitOps practices in deploying a complete DevSecOps project.

This first repository contains the application code as well as terraform code for setting up the EC2 instances.
